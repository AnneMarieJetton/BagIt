<h1>Welcome to the Bagit project!</h1>

<p>Bagit.com is simulated online grocery shopping website, complete with food suggestions on the front page, a functional cart, and a search option that makes use of an API. This project demonstrates vue and API knowledge, as well as component based web development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the API used in this project did not allow for searching by product name without paying for that feature, so the searchbar currently only functions with barcode number.</p>
